## Biography

My name is Steffi Tapsoba, I am Burkinabe and I am a Computer Science major at CSB/SJU in St. Joseph,MN. I came in the US in 2017 to study, which makes me an international student here! This year, I am a Senior, and I am terrified to graduate, but at the same time, I cannot wait to go out in the world and see what changes I can do, who I can influence and motivate.

## Projects

Summer 2020, I did some research with the Computer Science Department at CSB/SJU. My research was about creating a mathematical model to visualize and predict the spread of the novel cornavirus, Sars-Cov-2.

## Passions

Music is all my life. Since the womb I have been listening to music (quite literally. My father would play some music on my mother's belly). Now, I sing, I play some instruments (mainly the guitar and the piano), and I act! Those activites are what keep me sane, because being a Computer Science major is very stressful sometimes!

## Future

I plan on going to graduate school in Canada after I get by B.A in Computer Science. However, if I get a job, I would gladly do OPT for a year or two. Grad school can wait for that long, right?
